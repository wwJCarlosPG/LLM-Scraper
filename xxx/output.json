"explanation='The query asks for all offers. The HTML structure contains product information within <article> tags inside a <section id=\"ofertas\">. Each <article> has a <p class=\"precio-oferta\"> tag representing the offer price.  The code iterates through these articles, extracts the offer price, and returns them as a list of dictionaries.' scraped_data=[{'Offer': '$799.99'}, {'Offer': '$999.99'}, {'Offer': '$199.99'}] feedback=\"The query asks for all offers from the HTML. The HTML contains three product articles, each with an original price ('precio-original') and an offer price ('precio-oferta'). The extracted data correctly identifies the offer prices ('$799.99', '$999.99', and '$199.99') from each article's 'precio-oferta' paragraph. Therefore, the extraction accurately reflects the offers presented in the HTML.\" is_valid=True refinement_count=1"
